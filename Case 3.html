    <h1>Customer Segmentation</h1>
    <p>Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers based on similar characteristics, such as buying behavior, demographics, or preferences, to improve marketing strategies and customer experience. Algorithms like Binary Search, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort are essential for efficiently analyzing and organizing customer data.</p>

    <div class="algorithm">
     
        <p><strong>Binary Search</strong> is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted data. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty. With a time complexity of O(log n), it is ideal for large datasets.</p>
        
        <p>In customer segmentation, Binary Search can quickly identify and retrieve customer segments or specific customer attributes from large datasets, enabling personalized marketing strategies or tailored product recommendations.</p>
        
 
        <p><strong>Merge sort</strong> is a stable sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together. With a time complexity of O(n log n), it is efficient for sorting large datasets.</p>
        
        <p>In customer segmentation, Merge Sort can organize customer data, such as sorting by spending habits or preferences, to create well-defined groups. The stability of Merge Sort ensures that equal elements retain their original order, preserving the integrity of the dataset.</p>
        

        <p><strong>Quick sort</strong> is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the dataset into two subarrays based on the pivot. With an average time complexity of O(n log n), Quick Sort is efficient for large datasets.</p>
        
        <p>In customer segmentation, Quick Sort can quickly categorize customers into groups based on various metrics, such as purchase frequency or loyalty score, enabling businesses to develop targeted marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.</p>
